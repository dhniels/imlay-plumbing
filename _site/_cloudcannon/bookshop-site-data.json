Large molecules (solute) can’t cross the membrane, so they remain on one side. Water (solvent) can cross the membrane. The result is that solute molecules become more concentrated on one side of the membrane, while the opposite side becomes more dilute.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-reverse-osmosis-works\">How Reverse Osmosis Works </h2>\n\n<p>In order to understand reverse osmosis, it helps to first understand how mass is transported via diffusion and regular osmosis. Diffusion is the movement of moleculesfrom a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration. Osmosis is a special case of diffusion in which the molecules are water and the concentration gradient occurs across a semipermeable membrane. The semipermeable membrane allows the passage of water, but notions (e.g., Na+, Ca2+, Cl-) or larger molecules (e.g., glucose, urea, bacteria). Diffusion and osmosis are thermodynamically favorable and will continue until equilibrium is reached. Osmosis can be slowed, stopped, or even reversed if sufficient pressure is applied to the membrane from the ‘concentrated’ side of the membrane.</p>\n\n<p>Reverse osmosis occurs when the water is moved across the membrane <em>against the concentration gradient</em>, from lower concentration to higher concentration. To illustrate, imagine a semipermeable membrane with fresh water on one side and a concentrated aqueous solution on the other side. If normal osmosis takes place, the fresh water will cross the membrane to dilute the concentrated solution. In reverse osmosis, pressure is exerted on the side with the concentrated solution to force the water molecules through the membrane to the freshwater side.</p>\n\n<p>There are different pore sizes of membranes used for reverse osmosis. While a small pore size does a better job of filtration, it takes longer to move water. It’s sort of like trying to pour water through a strainer (large holes or pores) compared to trying to pour it through a paper towel (smaller holes). However, reverse osmosis is different from simple membrane filtration because it involves diffusion and is affected by flow rate and pressure.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"uses-of-reverse-osmosis\">Uses of Reverse Osmosis </h2>\n\n<p>Reverse osmosis is often used in commercial and residential water filtration. It is also one of the methods used to desalinate seawater. Reverse osmosis not only reduces salt, but can also filter out metals, organic contaminants, and pathogens. Sometimes reverse osmosis is used to purify liquids in which water is an undesirable impurity. For example, reverse osmosis can be used to purify ethanol or grain alcohol to increase its proof.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"history-of-reverse-osmosis\">History of Reverse Osmosis </h2>\n\n<p>Reverse osmosis is not a new purification technique. The first examples of osmosis through semipermeable membranes was described by Jean-Antoine Nollet in 1748. While the process was known in laboratories, it wasn’t used for desalination of seawater until 1950 at the University of California in Los Angeles. Multiple researchers refined methods of using reverse osmosis to purify water, but the process was so slow that it wasn’t practical on a commercial scale. New polymers allowed for the production of more efficient membranes. By the beginning of the 21st century, desalination plants became capable of desalinating water at the rate of 15 million gallons per day, with around 15,000 plants in operation or planned.</p>\n\n<p>Article Source:</p>\n\n<p>Helmenstine, Anne Marie, Ph.D. “How Reverse Osmosis Works.” ThoughtCo, Aug. 27, 2020, thoughtco.com/reverse-osmosis-overview-609400.</p>\n","url":"/news/how-a-reverse-osmosis-system-works","relative_path":"_posts/2022-02-25-how-a-reverse-osmosis-system-works.md","permalink":null}],"pages":[{"draft":false,"categories":[],"layout":"default","title":"About Us","content_blocks":[{"_bookshop_name":"page-heading","title":"About","description":null},{"_bookshop_name":"page-image","image":"/uploads/about-hero.jpg","image_alt":"About Imlay Plumbing"},{"_bookshop_name":"content","content_html":"<p>Imlay Plumbing caters to both residential and commercial clients.

When a new home is built, it is often plumbed with a “softener loop” that allows treated water to flow to fixtures. However, we also offer water conditioning systems. Customers can still enjoy many of the benefits of softened water without the significant cost of re-plumbing the house. We also install reverse osmosis (RO) systems for pure, healthy drinking water! We can take a look at your unique situation and make a recommendation based on your needs.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"benefits\">Benefits</h2>\n\n<p>Softer water is better all around! Water is called “hard water” if it contains excessive amounts of certain minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium, because these substances leave a hard scale on surfaces that come in contact with the water. You can tell you have hard water if there’s build-up on your sinks and bathtubs, or if you have to use large amounts of soap to clean dishes or wash your hair. It also allows your water heater to heat up quicker and prolongs its useful life by reducing scale buildup inside the unit!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Water Softener</strong></p>\n\n<p>A traditional water softening system uses a filter element combined with a brine tank. The filter contains ionizing “beads” that bind to the minerals in the water and remove them from the incoming water supply. The brine tank is filled with salt every few months and is used during the softeners self-cleaning cycle to wash and flush the buildup of minerals inside the filter. This is the cheapest and most effective method for softening a home’s water supply. We recommend that the home be plumbed with a softener loop before installing this type of system.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/uploads/water-softening-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Traditional Water Softener\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Salt-Free Water Treatment</strong></p>\n\n<p>For homes not plumbed for soft water, we can install Nuvo H20 systems to help treat the water with a citrus filter that helps reduce scale buildup on fixtures. More information about these types of filters can be found on the <a href=\"https://nuvoh2o.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nuvo website</a>.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/uploads/water-softening-2.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Salt-Free Water Softener\" width=\"710\" height=\"947\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Reverse Osmosis (RO) Purified Water</strong></p>\n\n<p>Additionally, a Reverse Osmosis (RO) system using a series of filters reduces many microscopic impurities and chemical elements. It is also the only type of drinking water treatment that fully removes fluoride from the water.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Cleaner sinks, bathtubs, fixtures and tile</li>\n  <li>Cleaner, brighter laundry</li>\n  <li>Less time &amp; soap spent scrubbing the kitchen and bathroom</li>\n  <li>Smoother, shinier skin and hair</li>\n  <li>Convenient, better tasting drinking water</li>\n  <li>Use less coffee grounds and juice concentrate</li>\n  <li>Reduce scale in fixtures, appliances</li>\n  <li>Clear, refreshing ice cubes</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img src=\"/uploads/water-softening-3.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1843\" height=\"1920\" /></p>\n","url":"/service/water-softening-treatment","relative_path":"_services/2021-01-06-water-softening-treatment.md","permalink":null},{"draft":false,"categories":[],"layout":"service","date":"2021-01-07 20:20:35 -0700","title":"Water Heating","subtitle":"We install and service both tank and tankless heating systems.","image":"/uploads/water-heating.jpg","slug":"water-heating","ext":".md","tags":[],"excerpt":"<h1 id=\"water-heating\">Water Heating</h1>\n","content":"<h1 id=\"water-heating\">Water Heating</h1>\n\n<p>Who doesn’t love hot water?

They also fit with most existing houses’ venting. Tankless units require special venting that adds additional cost to run on top of the unit itself which costs around twice as much. Additionally, tankless heaters can struggle when many fixtures are run at once since they can only produce so much hot water at a time.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Cheap up front cost, high compatibility</li>\n  <li>Little to no maintenance, easy repairs</li>\n  <li>Low instantaneous power requirement</li>\n  <li>Better at handling simultaneous usage</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img src=\"/uploads/water-heating-3.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1440\" height=\"1920\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Tankless Water Heaters</strong></p>\n\n<p>However, converting your water heater to a tankless model is a valuable upgrade for any home. These units last longer, use less energy, offer endless hot water and <em>can</em> reduce utility bills.</p>\n\n<p>While tankless water heaters are the new trend right now, we still recommend traditional tank water heaters in most cases.</p>\n\n<p>Tankless heaters can have many advantages for the right household.

We only use schedule 40 PVC when installing the new line. Many builders today go cheap with “SDR” which is a thin walled plastic pipe that is subject to being crushed when the dirt is filled and compacted back over it. It’s a cheap pipe that saves a few dollars at the expense of the homeowner in the long run. Imlay Plumbing has the knowledge and expertise to watch out for your best interest so you know you’re getting a permanent, quality fix.</p>\n\n<p>We will run our sewer camera and determine if the entire line needs replacement, or, in some cases only a spot fix is required.
