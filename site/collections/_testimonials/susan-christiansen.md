  We are having our shower redone. Cam was completing the project. He was
  wonderful to work with. Very courteous, professional and detail oriented. The
  job was done professionally and on time. And the cleanup was spotless.  So
  glad we chose to Imlay Plumbing do our project. Will use them for all our
  plumbing needs. Thanks again Cam for a job well done.
