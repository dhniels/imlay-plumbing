  We had a pipe burst in our wall at 4:45 this morning. I called their number at
  7:30AM, Spencer showed up at 9:30, removed our water heater, diagnosed and
  fixed the broken pipe, and was on his way by 10:45! His services were greatly
  appreciated on a Saturday morning! Imlay Plumbing now has a customer for life!
