# Drain Cleaning & Inspection

If you have a slow or plugged drain, we are here to help. We understand the frustration of not being able to use your plumbing systems and the mess created when you have a backup. Our plumbers are provided with a wide assortment of tools and equipment to get your sewer flowing agin and can also provide a camera inspection to identify problems with the drain pipes. We can diagnose, clean, and repair, depending on your unique situation.

&nbsp;

## Clogged Drains

Roots and buildup can slow down or even block your fixtures from draining properly. When this happens we frequently see hazardous backups. Sewer maintenance from Imlay Plumbing can save you serious money in the long run by preventing costly repairs or pipe replacements.&nbsp;

**Examples of clogs:**

&nbsp;

* Kitchen and bar sink drains due to soap, grease, and food buildup
* Bathroom sink/tub/shower drains due to hair, soap, and oil buildup
* Weak flushing toilets from toilet paper, wipes, and scale buildup
* Floor drains from dirt, rocks, and debris or other foreign objects
* Washing machine drains from detergent, oil, and suds buildup

**Equipment we use:**

* Medium drain snake or sink snake designed for 1.5" to 2" drain lines.
* Sink snake designed small enough to work its way through p-traps
* Main line snake designed for clearing tough clogs and roots in larger pipes
* Hyrdo-jetter acting like a pressure washer to clean constricted, greasy pipes
* Milwaukee AirSnakeâ„¢ to break up hardened clogs in toilets, floor drains, and urinals

## Camera Inspections

Sometimes replacing or repairing the line is the best way forward. Old sewer lines can build up with grease, hair, scale and mineral buildup, and other foreign objects. Root invasion is another common culprit of backups. This is especially common in older homes with galvanized, cast iron, clay, and orangeburg sewer lines.

We will modernize your sewer system by replacing old, broken, squashed, and rusted pipes with new, strong, and smooth-walled schedule 40 PVC. We avoid using thin walled SDR drain pipe commonly used to save a few dollars because it ends up costing customers tens of thousands to inevitably replace it when it fails. We always prioritize doing the job right so it only has to be done once.
