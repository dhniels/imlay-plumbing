## Imlay Plumbing, Excavation, and Blackstar Works

We are currently working toward offering an in-house solution for any construction from start to finish. From a general contractor, excavation crew, plumbing, electrical, and beyond…our goal is to save our clients time and money by having the ability to handle everything under one roof. We will provide a truly one-of-a-kind solution for Cedar City and Iron County as a whole. Our competition simply can’t offer the same level of services.
